# Go Gin Server with Docker Compose
This is a testing for using Docker Compose to manage 5 Go Gin Server to simulate the kubernetes instructure. The idea is coming for Amazon Web Services, but it is hard to design with redirect program. This approach try to use Nginx to make redirect action for 5 microservices api servers without internal communications.
